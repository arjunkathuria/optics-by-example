Exercise 2 "Lens Composition" of chatper 4 - Polymorphic optics

1. Quess 1.
   
   Fill in the blank with the appropriate composition of tuple lenses in the following statement:
   
   #+begin_example 
     >>> view _ ("Ginerva", (("Galileo", "Waldo"), "Malfoy"))
     "Waldo"
   #+end_example

   Answer:
   
   #+begin_src haskell
     import Control.Lens

     let structure = ("Ginerva", (("Galileo", "Waldo"), "Malfoy")) in
       view (_2 . _1 . _2) structure
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Waldo

   Given the following lens types, fill in the missing type of mysteryDomino

   #+begin_src haskell
     fiveEightDomino :: Lens' Five Eight
     mysteryDomino :: Lens' ???? ????
     twoThreeDomino :: Lens' Two Three
       
     dominoTrain :: Lens' Five Three
     dominoTrain = fiveEightDomino . mysteryDomino . twoThreeDomino
   #+end_src

   Answer:
   #+begin_src haskell
     mysteryDomino :: Lens' Eight Two
   #+end_src

   Using what you know about how lenses work under the hood; rewrite the following signature
   as a polymorphic lens of the form: Lens s t a b. Then identify each animal as one of:
   pre-action structure, post-action structure, pre-action focus, post-action focus

   #+begin_src haskell
     Functor f => (Armadillo -> f Hedgehog) -> (Platypus -> f BabySloth)
   #+end_src

   Answer:

   #+begin_src haskell
     animals :: Lens Platypus BabySloth Armadillo Hedgehog
     --                <s>       <t>       <a>       <b>
   #+end_src

   - pre-action structure  - s - Platypus
   - post-action structure - t - Babysloth
   - pre-action focus      - a - Armadillo
   - post-action focus     - b - Hedgehog

   Find a way to compose ALL of the following lenses together into one big path using each exactly once.
   Whatâ€™s the type of the resulting lens?

   #+begin_src haskell
     spuzorktrowmble :: Lens Chumble Spuzz Gazork Trowlg

     gazorlglesnatchka :: Lens Gazork Trowlg Bandersnatch Yakka

     zinkattumblezz :: Lens Zink Wattoom Chumble Spuzz

     gruggazinkoom :: Lens Grug Pubbawup Zink Wattoom

     banderyakoobog :: Lens Bandersnatch Yakka Foob Mog

     boowockugwup :: Lens Boojum Jabberwock Grug Pubbawup

     snajubjumwock :: Lens Snark JubJub Boojum Jabberwock
   #+end_src

   Answer.

   #+begin_src haskell
     snajubjumwock
     . boowockugwup
     . gruggazinkoom
     . zinkattumblezz
     . spuzorktrowmble
     . gazorlglesnatchka
     . banderyakoobog
   #+end_src
